This is the source code of the MMDVM-TNC-Tester which sends a series of UI frames over KISS and receives them back. It is based on work by Nino KK4HEJ and converted into C++ and convered for use with modems in loopback mode.

It is written in standard C++ and should compile on most platforms.

This software is licenced under the GPL v2 and is primarily intended for amateur and educational use.
